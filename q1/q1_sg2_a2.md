# **Questions with Checklists** 

# **1. Efficiency** 

Which algorithm is faster when the list of numbers is very large? Why? 

PseudoCode 1 is faster because it uses only one loop, checking each number once. While PseudoCode 2 uses two nested loops, so it takes much more time. 

|**PseudoCode 1**|**PseudoCode 2**|
|---|---|
|Does the algorithm use one loop or<br>two nested loops?|Does the algorithm use one loop or<br>two nested loops?|
|Does the algorithm repeat work<br>unnecessarily?|Does the algorithm repeat work<br>unnecessarily?|

# **2. Readability** 

Which algorithm is easier to understand at first glance? What makes it clearer? 

Pseudocode 1 is the easiest as it is more concise, and there are no unnecessary functions. 

# **Checklist to guide your answer:** 

|**PseudoCode 1**|**PseudoCode 2**|
|---|---|
|Are variable names meaningful|Are variable names meaningful|
|(e.g., max vs. bigger)?|(e.g., max vs. bigger)?|
|Is the logic simple or complicated?|Is the logic simple or complicated?|
|Are there fewer lines of code?|Are there fewer lines of code?|



# **3. Maintainability** 

If you had to add a new feature (like finding both max and min), which algorithm would be easier to update? Why? 

It would be easier to update Pseudocode 1 since it’s a lot simpler to break down and has shorter lines of code. 



# **Checklist to guide your answer:** 

|**PseudoCode 1**|**PseudoCode 2**|
|---|---|
|Is the structure straightforward?|Is the structure straightforward?|
|Would adding new steps break the<br>code easily?|Would adding new steps break the<br>code easily?|
|Is there less chance of errors when<br>updating?|Is there less chance of errors when<br>updating?|



# **4. Testability** 

Which algorithm is easier to test with different inputs? Why? 

PseudoCode 1 is easier to test because there is only 1 loop with fewer conditions to check. The code is simpler to observe and fix. 

# **Checklist to guide your answer:** 

|**PseudoCode 1**|**PseudoCode 2**|
|---|---|
|Can you test with small lists easily?|Can you test with small lists easily?|
|Does the algorithm have fewer|Does the algorithm have fewer|
|conditions to check?|conditions to check?|
|Is the output predictable and clear?|Is the output predictable and clear?|



# **5. Security** 

Imagine the input list comes from a user. What should the algorithm check to avoid errors or misuse? 

The algorithm should check if the input is a list, empty, undefined value, or non-number. 

# **Checklist to guide your answer:** 

|**PseudoCode 1**|**PseudoCode 2**|
|---|---|
|Does the algorithm check if the list<br>is empty?|Does the algorithm check if the list<br>is empty?|
|Does it handle invalid inputs (like<br>letters instead of numbers)?|Does it handle invalid inputs (like<br>letters instead of numbers)?|
|Does it avoid crashing when inputs<br>are unusual?|Does it avoid crashing when inputs<br>are unusual?|



# **6. Final Answer** 

Based on your answers from 1 to 5, which one is the better algorithm that you will use to solve the problem of finding the highest number? Why? Summarize your answer 

Pseudocode 1 is better because it is more concise, easily understandable, and testable, and has less chance of error.
